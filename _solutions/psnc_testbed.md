description: **PSNC FutureLabs** are the living labs in education, eHealth, smart City (https://futurelabs.psnc.pl/en/projekty/). Each of the labs provides different kinds of technologies, etc. **PIONIER-LAB** (https://pionier-lab.pionier.net.pl/laby/) - is one the largest Polish Research Infrastructure roadmap project, in which one of the laboratories is Smart Campus as Smart City. It creates the testbed of 12 smart campuses in Poland, with many  sensors and infrastructure around smart spaces, parking, monitoring, energy, and others. The testbed will be available through the IoT/edge platforms for experimentation. **eDWIN** (https://www.edwin.gov.pl/) is a national platform for integrated plant protection, and provides access to network of agrometeo stations
